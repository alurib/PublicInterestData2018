# Reading, Schedule, Resources 

We'll be using Garrett Grolemund's and Hadley Wickham's freely available [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) as an R resource and [A research synthesis on child welfare disproportionality and disparities](https://www.cssp.org/publications/child-welfare/alliance/Disparities-and-Disproportionality-in-Child-Welfare_An-Analysis-of-the-Research-December-2011.pdf) produced by the Center for the Study of Social Policy and others as a subject resource. Additional materials are either freely available and linked here or provided on our collab page. Most of the assigned reading will occur in the first few weeks.

## January 19, 2018
Since we only have 10 weeks together, we'll be diving in on day one with discussions about working collaboriatively and for a client, ethical considerations and data security, and some background on our research question. 

* What does it mean to use data in the public interest? Read the GovLab's [Five principles for applying data science for social good](http://thegovlab.org/five-principles-for-applying-data-science-for-social-good/)
* How will we work collaboratively and with a client? Click through DataKind's Labs Blueprient [Module 4: Six Components of Successful Lab Projects](http://www.datakind.org/blog/introducing-our-new-labs-blueprint)
* What are some ethical considerations in using adminsitrative data? Read Stiles and Boothroyd's [Ethical Use of Administrative Data for Research Purposes](https://www.aisp.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0033_12_SP2_Ethical_Admin_Data_001.pdf) (2015), focusing on pages 4-11 and 22-29.
* What are the broad outlines of our/our client's questions and concerns? Scan the Children's Bureau Issue Brief (November 2016) on [Racial Disproportionality and Disparity in Child Welfare](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/racial_disproportionality.pdf)
* How do we address heightened sensititives and local interest on the project? Watch this story aired in Charlottesville's local CBS 19 News on January 5, 2018 - [Data shows minority children disproportionately in foster care](http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Data-shows-minority-children-disproportionately-in-foster-care-468157653.html). Really, you're going to want to spend 3 minutes watching this!

## January 26, 2018
Our clients will be joining us this day as we delve into the prior research around racial disproportionality and disparity in child welfare systems. We'll start by collectively presenting the key points from the research synthesis. Everyone is responsible for the first section of the research synthesis, and I'll begin by choosing individuals to summarize definitions and frameworks to ensure we're starting with the same understanding. To practice presenting and communicating research, teams of two (or three, if needed) lab members will have seven minutes to brief the class and clients on a section of hte report, followed by three minutes for follow up questions. Our clients will give us some additional local context and we'll have a chance to start asking them some questions.

[A research synthesis on child welfare disproportionality and disparities](https://www.cssp.org/publications/child-welfare/alliance/Disparities-and-Disproportionality-in-Child-Welfare_An-Analysis-of-the-Research-December-2011.pdf). Center for the Study of Social Policy, December 2011. pp. 7-70
* Section 0 (everybody): pp. 7-22
* Section 1: pp. 23-28, 43-46
* Section 2: pp. 29-42 
* Section 3: 47-49, 62-63, 64-70 
* Section 4: 50-61 

In the second half of the class, we'll start reviewing the data dictionary for the data provided by DSS. Working in groups, we'll begin brainstorming questions and hypotheses that can be addressed with the data, possibliities for supplementing the data, and more. Groups will submit notes that will be shared with the lab.

## February 2, 2018
Lab members will have access to the data after our 1/26 meeting and can start exploring the data right away. In the first part of class, we'll draft a formal problem statement, discuss the ideas generated in last week's class, and devise a more formal research plan. We'll spend the second half of class going over some concepts of working in R and working with (potentially different aspects of) the data in groups.

## February 9, 2018
Things start to get a little more free-flowing here as we spend more time working on the data and project. We'll spend some time going over some data wrangling concepts as well as sharing progress and providing feedback.
