## Deliberations on inclusion of "race" as variable
In response to my February 16 email:
"everyone should send me an individual email with (1) your weekly update and (2) you’re considered opinion about how we should incorporate race into the models (e.g., white-black-multiracial-other? white alone–black and black multiracial-nonblack multiracial and others? White-nonwhite (though, as I said, I think that’s problematic for multiple reasons)? white and nonblack multiracial-black and black multiracial-black/white multiracial (Bharat's suggestion, though I may have botched it)? include non-exclusive binary indicators? Something else?"

* I support White-Black-"Race that has the third number of counts in the dataset” - Others. 
* When incorporating race into our study, I think we should use the white-black-multiracial-other method of creating groups. If we divide into more subgroups, the sample sizes of each will be very small, to the point where it is hard to draw conclusions. This configuration allows us to highlight the group discussed the most in the initial paper, black children.
* In terms of how we should incorporate race into our model, I think it would be good to run through a general variable for race and then a more specific variable for race through the model, to gauge any macro and micro disparities that exist. For the general variable for race, I do think there is weight in creating a white and non-white variable for the sake of gauging the full impact of whiteness on the system compared to those who are not white. As I know that this might not be favored, creating a white, black and multiracial variable could be a compromise. For the more specific variable, I think it would be effective to make a variable coding for white alone, black and black multiracial, nonblack multiracial and others. 
* In my opinion, I think it is better to have white, black, multiracial and others. Since discrimination at decision points is a result of how the others perceive you, it may be less important to be too specific to white, white-multiracial, black, black-multiracial, and others. Since any multiracial (black or white) will be treated as multiracial.
* I think there is a case to be made for comparing white children and children of color, including multiracial children. In Charlottesville, the racial divide and disparity tend to be black/white. In my experiences, multiracial black children tend to be taken as black. But I think there’s also an argument to be made about levels of privilege and keeping it separate. I might go through some other studies to see. 
* As far as the categorizing the race goes why not try races coded differently for our models to see which categorizing works well. I have two ideas-
   1. Black-Black multiracial w/o white,
       White - white multiracial w/o black,
       Black-white multiracial,
       Others.
   2. Black-Black w/ multiracial any,
       White - white w/ multiracial other than w/ black,
       Others.
 * The question of how we should incorporate race into the models is a complicated question. I have changed my mind multiple times. I think we should model race something like: 
   1. white alone - black and black multiracial - nonblack multiracial - others. 
It pains me a bit to have such simplified categories as "other" but we do not have many Asian/Pacific Islander/Native American children in our data, and the analysis should reflect both the reality we live in (the Charlottesville Child Welfare System) and the needs/wishes of our client; what will be most useful for them; what analysis will actually help them provide better care? Keeping the categories few and simplified, although it is harder ethically, strengthens the statistical power of our analysis. We can always state at the beginning of our report the reasons behind our set up. The reason I think we should combine black and black multiracial, and separate nonblack multiracial, lies in how race is perceived and in the racial biases of care providers. Everyone has implicit biases and there are so many points throughout the care system where a welfare worker could be implicitly treating a child of color differently than a white child. I think we need to include multiracial black children with black rather than white because in the world we live in, to put things extremely bluntly, multiracial black children do not get viewed as white if they are mixed white and black. Our code should not live in a world that these children do not live in. Something that might help with the uneasy/uncomfortable feelings around all this is the language around race - it's uncomfortable to talk about "white" and "everything else" so maybe we could re-label our categories? We could look at reports from similar projects; some other papers on race and racial relations perhaps; and see what others have done and if we like it?
