## First Draft of Problem Statements, three takes

Based on the DataKind model

### Take 1

* __We want to:__  compare referrals, process, and outcomes for children of differnet races; 
* __Using:__ statistical analysis, visualization, decision point parameters and population parameters; 
* __So that:__ we can determine whether there is racial disproportionality and/or disparity in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System, and report that information to inform policy;
* __So that:__  all children are treated fairly irrespective of race.

### Take 2

* __We want to:__  visualize and subset data; 
* __Using:__ foster care data; 
* __So that:__ we can determine the most significant factors that lead to children being placed in (or exiting) foster care;
* __So that:__  the Charlottesville community can address specific groups or needs.

### Take 3

* __We want to:__  statistically examine (1) if the proportion of referrals called in, screened in, and founded is the same for white and non-white children; and (2) if there is a difference in length of stay and placement between white and non-white children; 
* __Using:__ the DSS data; 
* __So that:__ we can examine if there is disproportionality;
* __So that:__  disproportionality/disparity can be addressed with changes in implementation to the process.

## Second Draft of Problem Statement, combined and refined

* __We want to:__ (1) estimate baseline racial disproportionality in child welfare referrals and acceptances; (2) estimate racial disparity in post-referral decision points, both baseline disparity and modeling decision outcomes as a function of race and other characteristics; (3) estimate racial disparity in foster care outcomes, both baseline disparity and modeling outcomes as a function of race and other characteristics;
* __Using:__
