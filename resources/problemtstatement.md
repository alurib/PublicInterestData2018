## First Draft of Problem Statements, three takes

Based on the DataKind model

### Take 1

* ** We want to: **  compare referrals, process, and outcomes for children of differnet races; 
* ** Using: ** statistical analysis, visualization, decision point parameters and population parameters; 
* ** So that: ** we can determine whether there is racial disproportionality and/or disparity in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System, and report that information to inform policy;
* ** So that:**  all children are treated fairly irrespective of race.

### Take 2

* ** We want to: **  visualize and subset data; 
* ** Using: ** foster care data; 
* ** So that: ** we can determine the most significant factors that lead to children being placed in (or exiting) foster care;
* ** So that:**  the Charlottesville community can address specific groups or needs.

### Take 3

* ** We want to: **  statistically examine (1) if the proportion of referrals called in, screened in, and founded is the same for white and non-white children; and (2) if there is a difference in length of stay and placement between white and non-white children; 
* ** Using: ** the DSS data; 
* ** So that: ** we can examine if there is disproportionality;
* ** So that:**  disproportionality/disparity can be addressed with changes in implementation to the process.
