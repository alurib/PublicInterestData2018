# Practices for Sharing Client Data

To insure the security of [moderately sensitive client data](http://security.virginia.edu/university-data-protection-standards#Data Sensitivity Classifications and Examples), lab members agree to the following practices and terms.

1. The data will be available on a shared UVA Box folder. Lab members should [sync this folder to their computers](https://virginia.app.box.com/settings/sync).
2. Lab members should encrypt this folder with password protection. 
  * Charlotte provided [this link for Macs](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/encrypt-mac-folder/). Once protected, unsync the initial Box folder and use the new .dmg file. To use the folder, click on the .dmg file to mount it (if you can't find the .dmg file, search with spotlight); it should be visible in Finder.
  * Still working on PC instructions
3. Lab members should not make any additional copies of the data file, including no copies on portable storage devices, and no copies on public machines.
4. When working with the data, lab members should not leave their computers unattended. 
5. When seeking help with code or analysis from those outside the lab, lab members should not share or show the full data file to colleagues outside the lab.
