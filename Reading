# Resources and Readings 

We'll be using Garrett Grolemund's and Hadley Wickham's freely available [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) as an R resource and [A research synthesis on child welfare disproportionality and disparities](https://www.cssp.org/publications/child-welfare/alliance/Disparities-and-Disproportionality-in-Child-Welfare_An-Analysis-of-the-Research-December-2011.pdf) produced by the Center for the Study of Social Policy and others as a subject resource. Additional materials are either freely available and linked here or provided on our collab page. Most of the assigned reading will occur in the first few weeks.

## January 19, 2018
Since we only have 10 weeks together, we'll be diving in on day one with discussions about working collaboriatively and for a client, ethical considerations and data security, and some background on our research question. 

* What does it mean to use data in the public interest? Read the GovLab's [Five principles for applying data science for social good](http://thegovlab.org/five-principles-for-applying-data-science-for-social-good/)
* How will we work collaboratively and with a client? Click through DataKind's Labs Blueprient [Module 4: Six Components of Successful Lab Projects](http://www.datakind.org/blog/introducing-our-new-labs-blueprint)
* What are some ethical considerations in using adminsitrative data? Read Stiles and Boothroyd's [Ethical Use of Administrative Data for Research Purposes](https://www.aisp.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0033_12_SP2_Ethical_Admin_Data_001.pdf) (2015), focusing on pages 4-11 and 22-29.
* What are the broad outlines of our/our client's questions and concerns? Scan the Children's Bureau Issue Brief (November 2016) on [Racial Disproportionality and Disparity in Child Welfare](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/racial_disproportionality.pdf)
* How do we address heightened sensititives and local interest on the project? Watch this story aired in Charlottesville's local CBS 19 News on January 5, 2018 - [Data shows minority children disproportionately in foster care](http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Data-shows-minority-children-disproportionately-in-foster-care-468157653.html). Really, you're going to want to spend 3 minutes watching this!
