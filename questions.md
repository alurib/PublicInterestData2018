# Research questions, data questions

## Research questions
The DSS has some initial, broad questions:

1. Is there evidence of racial disproportionality in the local child welfare system, e.g., disproportionate referrals, acceptance?
2. Is there evidence of racial disparity in outcomes, e.g., placement in foster care, time in the system?

To both parse and supplement these, lab members proposed additional research questions that might be addressed with the available data:

1. How does the demographic of foster care children change over time (1999-2017)?
2. Was there racial bias in First Reporter Relations and meaningful contact?
3. Are in home investigations of non-white families more likely to be founded than white families? Are they founded at higher levels?
4. Is there a difference in length of stay for kids of the minority race vs. non-minority?
5. Is there a relationship between the race of the referred clients and the rate of screened out applications? 
6. What is the ratio of colored children referred to the CPS and children referred to CPS as the denominator?
7. Are black children more likely to be placed with relatives than other children? Do they spend more time in out of home placement?
8. Is there a correlation between race and the decision to send the case to either investigation or family assessment? Given that family assessments don’t make a finding that stays in the parent’s records while investigations do, this could be a potential disparity in outcomes for the parents. 
9. Is there a correlation between response priority and race?
10. What factors are related to the initial decision of screening in or out a child when they are referred?
11. Which race has the most cases? 
12. Who is more likely to report a case? (we can advocate people in that industry to work harder in this area, so that more children will be helped)
13. Which months are more likely to receive more meaningful contact?
14. Will there be a relationship between "Face to Face Count" and the Case Begin and End Date? Does more contact with DSS bode for a better, same, or worse outcome for the child? Are there racial disparities in contact with DSS?

## Data questions

Referral data
1. Case id: distinction between cases and clients; 222222222222 appears for cases that are screened out (but not all screened out cases) or for cases that are closed (but not all closed cases)?
2. Meaning of disposition alternatives (DRS, Founded level 1,2,3)?
3. Difference between meaningful first contact and first contact?
4. Response Priority - How long later does the Moderate and Low get processed?
5. How often can the reporter referred a child? For example, if the caller finds out that the application was screened out, can he/she immediately put in a referral again?
6. How is response priority (R1,R2,R3) determined? By a screening tool or individual?
7. What is the difference between “Unable To Determine” and “Race Unknown”?
8. Some cases are listed as having no “meaningful”, others have first contact but no response priority. Why is that?

Ongoing data
1. Relation of Case Type Begin Date and Client Involvement Start date; how these relate to referral dates?
2. Relation of Case Type End Data and Client Involvement End date?

Foster care data
1. Relation of Custody Date to Enter Care date, should these be the same?
2. Relation of Custody End to Exit Care Date?
3. Relation of Discharge Date to Custoy End; discharge is when case file is closed?

Placement data
1. Under “Placement History” what does it mean when a child exits because the “Placement cannot meet the child’s behavioral needs”? Are we able to access data on where the child goes after leaving for this reason? Also, is this determined by the foster family or by a caseworker?
2. AWOL_BEGIN_DT — what is this measurement? What does date beginning duration of gap in care (with no exit) mean?

Potentially all datasets
1. From my point of view, we can use SSN to represent each child, since the case ID, client ID and referral ID can be the same for different children. By the way, can we ignore these three variables?
2. For all questions about race, some races may have more people in Charlottesville, therefore their cases are definitely more than other races. In this case, we may not be able to know whether race matter in this area. How can we solve this problem?
